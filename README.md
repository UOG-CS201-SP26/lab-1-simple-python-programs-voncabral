# Lab 1: Simple Python Programs

The purpose of this series of labs is to get you started on python programming, identifying problems or scenarios and coming up with solutions. Chapter 1 doesn't have enough content for more involved labs, but there is enough for simple ones. 

Since this is the beginning, I am not too strict on how you should be coding these. We will build the knowledge of coding and programming as we progress through our textbook.

## Review on what was learnt

| Function | Description | Example Use |
|-|-|-|
| `print()`  | Displays output to the console | `print("Hello World!")`   | 
| `input()` | Prompts the user for input from console   | `name = input("What is your name?: ")`  | 
| `int()` | Converts string into integer value | `age = int("25")` |
| `float()` | Converts string into floating-point value | `pi = float("3.14159")` |


## Grading Criteria

| Lab Number | Description | Functionality | Test Cases | Total Points | 
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Lab 1  | Age in 5 years!   | 10pts   | 5pts | 15pts
| Lab 2  | Lyrics to favorite song   | 10pts   | 0pts | 10pts
| Lab 3 | Mini Madlibs! | 15pts | 15pts | 30pts
| Lab 4 | Area of Circle | 10pts | 5pts | 15pts
| Lab 5 | Profile Maker! | 20pts | 10pts | 30pts
| Total | | | | 100pts

Note that Test Cases are graded by your professor testing them. Functionality tl;dr just means if your program works.

## Test Cases

Please note that the test cases are **examples** on how your code should work, not templates for you to copy. They show you what inputs to try and what kind of behavior to expect, but you have complete freedom in how you implement and present your solution.

**Note:** Not all labs will contain test cases for you to try. In the times with no test cases it is your job to work it out.
